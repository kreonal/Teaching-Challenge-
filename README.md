This tutorial does not include the instructions for how to download Sass. 
If you are working on a Mac, then you already have Ruby (the program needed to utilize Sass on your computer) downloaded. 
All you need to do now is go to Sass's website and follow the prompts on how to install Sass either using the command
line or installing another program. We used the command line and find this to be the easiest way to install Sass.
If you are working on a PC, you will need to Google how to download Ruby and then follow the steps regarding how to 
install Sass!
